README - bin dir
================
This file is a placeholder to make the dir available on cloning.

This dir is used to hold binaries generated using ../build.sh.
It currently actually does contain binaries because I thought they are small enough to keep in the repo.
They will be removed soon for two reasons:
	
1. Binaries dont belong in repos in general. I'd originally kept them in for ease of distribution. jNV is an individual itch being scratched; the only person I expect to "download and play" is me from my other machine.
2. Even the purpose of sharing with myself didnt quite work: my other machine's jdk version was different. So source version it is.
