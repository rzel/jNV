Tue Apr 16 10:28:46 2013 : Basic version working both in Java and Groovy. Current work is focused on the Java version because its the smaller of the two. Todos as of date:

[] Switch to java serialization to remove dependence on json and related conversion issues (esp date)
[] Modularize storage such that it can switch between different storage formats.
[] Add json back as an optional format
[] Make the search results display the last modified date as well
[] Make the contents rich text
[] Convert the About note into rich text
