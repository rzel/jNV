    "About": "\n    This is a clone of Notational Velocity written in Java/Groovy.\n    Please see http://notational.net for the original App.\n\n    The text below is abridged from the NV website and provided as an overview for users not familiar with the original NV.\n\n    NOTATIONAL VELOCITY is an application that stores and retrieves notes.\n    UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS\n    ======================\n        - Modeless Operation : Searching for notes is not a separate action; rather, it is the primary interface.\n        - [TBD in jNV] Incremental Search : Searching encompasses all notes' content and occurs instantly with each key pressed.\n        - [Non-goal in jNV] Transparent Database Encryption : All content is compressed and encrypted (enabled optionally) before it is recorded to disk.\n        - Mouseless Interaction : Notational Velocity's window was designed for keyboard input above all else, and thus has no buttons.\n        - Data Instead of Documents : There is no manual \"saving\" in Notational Velocity; all modifications take effect immediately. \n\n    HOW IT WORKS\n    ============\n    The UI has 3 areas: The search/title text field, the filtered note list and the content of the selected note.\n\n    The search/title text field is used both for creating notes and searching. i.e., in the process of entering the title for a new note, related notes appear below, letting users file information there if they choose. Likewise, if a search reveals nothing, one need simply press return to create a note with the appropriate title.\n\n    [TBD in jNV] If a note's title starts with the search term(s), that title will be \"auto-completed\". This selects the note and consequently displays it. Correspondingly, selecting a note places its title in the search area (De-selecting the note restores the search terms).\n\n    To create a new note, just type its title and press return. Edit the note as needed in the bottom pane.\n\n    To view or edit an existing note, type one or more words contained in its body [TBD in jNV] or title. Reveal a note's content by using the up/down arrow keys to select it.\n\n    To make good use of NV, try to maintain one detail/fact/item per note. Notational Velocity's strength, note-filtering, is diminished when only a few notes contain most of the content in the database.        \n                "
